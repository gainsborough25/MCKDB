PRESENTATION IDEAS


- Explanation of hobby and project scope
- "What I have made, here, is nothing short of average quality"
- dedicate section of video to include explaining ERD with viewing the tables
- Now moving to the programming side:
        - "Let's first take a look at the python code"
        - *show the ALL the code in a massive screen shot whilst sayin "here it is - only leave on screen for a couple seconds at max*
        - "okay now lemme show how it works..."
- "the only way I know how to program any kind of UI is through the use of menus...so menu time"




how to improve:

- keycapSet and colorsearch have a lot of redundancies - can probably consolidate somehow
- update has a lot of stuff missing - I can't, for example, update a color hex or color family, or vendor stuff - I can only update direct attributes of keycap sets
