1) search by vendor (DONE)
2) search by manu (DONE)
3) search by material (TOO MUCH OVERLAP WITH MANU - DONE)

4) INSERT stuff (DONE)

        - # of kits (to be inserted separate)
        - assign vendor (to be inserted separate)
        - add vendor


5) UPDATE stuff (DONE)
    - possibly create trigger to automatically put something like "not yet entered" in the # of kits and vendor reagions field 

6) DELETE stuff (DONE)
    - needed because sometimes kits are cancelled or renamed

7) video stuff  (DONE)
    - can write general script in this document

WHAT I LEARNED:

- I learned a lot....I mean, I learned how to do everything this video entails.
    - had to relearn a bit of python to make it all work, but luckily python comes back pretty quickly
    - I learned how to make a program talk to SQL, and at first I hated that I had to do it since I could do everything through SQL, but the program actually made things easier to do!
    - I learned that triggers are absolutely amazing for doing stuff
    - i could talk about a lot more, but i won't..

THINGS I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY / THINGS I CAN STILL WORK ON:

- I think, after having done this, I would have liked to learn Visual Studio and do C# stuff so I could make a desktop app.  The menu stuff is cool, but seems really archaic...
- This is for sure a passion project - I would like to, time permitting, actually finish this in some capacity.  If not for the community, for myself.
- My program doesn't have full functionality (explain verbally), and I do want to finish it, but for the scope of this project I decided not to impliment them

This project was difficult, time consuming, fristrating, exhausting, and extremly rewarding.  I am glad to have taken this class CS 364.  Thanks, to all my classmates and to Dr. C!!!
